# 🧩 CleanPatterns  
*A Minimal Console App Demonstrating Repository, Unit of Work, and Template Method Patterns in C#*

---

## 📘 Overview  

**CleanPatterns** is a lightweight educational console application built to demonstrate three essential design patterns commonly used in software architecture:

- **Repository Pattern** – Abstracts data access logic and promotes separation of concerns.  
- **Unit of Work Pattern** – Coordinates multiple repositories as a single logical transaction.  
- **Template Method Pattern** – Defines a common structure for operations while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps.

This project is intentionally designed **without any database** — all data is stored **in-memory**, making it perfect for educational purposes, code reviews, and design pattern demonstrations.
